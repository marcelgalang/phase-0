1.The 6 Phases of Web Design
  1.Information Gathering-  What is your purpose?  Your goals?  Who is the target audience of your site and what content will they be looking for?  This is the stage where those wuestions should be asked.
  2.Planning- Make a site map that knows what elements are required for the site.
  3.Design- Where the look and feel is considered for the target audience.
  4.Development- The site is created by the developer.
  5.Testing and Delivery- The site is available for testing for up to date standards and functionality and is then launched.
  6.Maintenance- The site is updated for content as well as web standards.  Developers keep the site working and relevant.

2-4. My site’s primary goal is to inform who I am as a developer and technologist and showcase what I can do.  It will feature my story, my resume, examples of my work and links to render a more detailed portrait of my professional self.  The site’s target audience will be most interested in finding out who I am as a developer in a brief amount of time.  Every action should lead to a presentation of more material that shows who I am.  The user should be lead to more examples of my work and my professional personality even as other sites are referenced.

5-6. Design is problem solving.  How to convey the importance of a sites content to the user or make the content useful to the user is what gets resolved.  A store to buy a product can be seemingly straight forward but what if the client wants the user to buy something they weren’t looking for?  I know my Amazon cart never has just what I remembered I needed before checkout.  This is a consideration of a number of things and design of the site is one of them.

User Experience is all about feel.  How does the site feel?  How does the user feel using it?  Is it remarkable so they comment on it?  Or is the feel invisible and the content readily available.  The tricky thing about UX is that it is not as trackable as much as design or development issues may be. An uptick in clicks or sales can be attributed to good design but how do you know the site has good feel without asking every user?

7.Operational and technical issues getting my site map jpeg show up in the Github repo was a challenge.  I learned about how to be patient with the github server (not everything shows up right away) and myself.  I had to make sure I was directing git correctly.  I also found considering the purpose of a UX designer a challenge as I had never done so before.
