# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# .map/.map! iterates the given code block to each element (of self).  In this case it adds 1 to the integers
#.kind_of? determines if the element is what we are looking for, in this case, an integer.  It is asking "what kind of element is this?"
#.each iterates over every key/value pair

# # Release 3: Reflect!
# # What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
