What are databases for?
It is a data structure to access large amount of data in a efficient way.
What is a one-to-many relationship?
This is when a parent record on one table  can have multiple children records on another table.
What is a primary key? What is a foreign key? How can you determine which is which?
Primary key is a unique key to a table.  A foreign key  originates from a different table and may not be unique on its host table.
How can you select information out of a SQL database? What are some general guidelines for that?
Information can be called by selecting records by id, columns, groupings, location( WHERE) and conditional rules to name a few.  Although it seems that the commands are limited the combinations to manipulate the data are great.

SELECT * FROM table_name
This is  a starting point to see the entire table.  Commands like WHERE, LIKE, GROUP BY can help thin the query.
