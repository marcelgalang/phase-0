// To Coder:  I can make the assumption all three functions will use the same original array but I still wrote them as separate ones.

// SUM

// Create a function named sum with an argument being the list of numbers
// Create an empty array
// Move the given list of numbers into the array.
// . From that array, create a new array that is an odd length
// Add up the odd length elements
// From the original array, the remaining elements should create a new array that is an even length
// Add up the even length elements


//   --
// MEAN

// 1.Create a function named mean with an argument being an array

// 2.from that array  create a new array with an odd number of elements
// 3.divide that sum by number of elements to get the average of odd length array

// 4.from the remainder of the original array sum the elements of this even length array
// 5.divide that sum by number of elements to get the average of even length elements

// --



// MEDIAN

// 1.Create a function called median that takes a list of numbers an argument
// 2. Create an empty array
// 3. Move the given list of numbers into the array.

// 4. From the array create an array that is of odd length
// 5. Divide the array by two
// 6. Take the quotient and use it as an index number to find the middle (or closest to middle) number

// 7. Repeat steps 4-6 for the even length array
