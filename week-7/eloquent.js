// Reflection

// What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?
// Both languages somewhat read like english and structures are similar.  JavaScript seems to not rely on inheritence as Ruby does.  Built-in methods seem more plentiful in Ruby.
// Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts?
// The art of thinking  logically is proven to be even more valuable moving from language to language.
// How do you feel about diving into JavaScript after reading these chapters?
// I feel like Iâ€™m trying to speak french after learning spanish and translating everything to spanish first.  But it drives me to learn as much of JavaScript as I can as quickly as I can.
