3.4 CSS Positioning Pair Challenge

Completed by Hana Worku and Marcel Galang 9/3/2015

How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The DevTools is a way to quickly test ideas without having to do all your coding.  You can check how different formatting and positioning impacts the elements right away.  Also, it automatically populates the values for each attribute- which could be helpful.


How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Ways to resize elements: through positioning and display attributes and/or having a fixed size (measured in ems or % of the screen).


What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute: It's absolutely not going anywhere.  It isn't influenced by other elements around it. However, it is dependent on its parents ( so it would influenced by the setting of another container, higher up on the tree, that surrounds it).

Fixed: For elements that you want to stay on the exact same place on the page viewport. Fixed elements don't moved when scroll.

Static:  Used to reset something that was absolute, fixed, or relative before.  This forcibly removes positioning added to the element prior.

Relative:  It is dependent and influenced by elements around it. It moves around the page depending on the size and positioning of elements around it fairly easily.

For us, easiest to use was fixed. We knew exactly where it would go relative to the viewport (how we see the screen).  Absolute was the most difficult becasse we still are trying to explain it to ourselves!

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Margin: Distance between elements, outside the border.

Border: The actual border surrounding an element (the picture frame)

Padding: Padding the like the mat in a photograph. It's the padding between the content (the photograph) an the border (the frame).

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

It was rubbing your belly and tapping your head at the same time.  A lot of multi-tasking! We spent a lot of time moving pieces that may or may not be relavent to the task at hand.  A lot of trail and error.
