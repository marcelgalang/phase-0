  <article>If you are new to version control then you may not know all of it’s main benefits.  Here are a few:
  <section><h2>Collaboration-</h2>
  Ease of collaboration is a big one.  You may have a project that requires many different team players to contribute.  Some will share content, others will share code.  Version control gives everyone on the team the freedom to work on any file at any given time.  Workflow is not bottlenecked to one a few peoples desktops.  Compared to sharing one master file, this is a huge benefit.
</section>
  <section><h2>Storing Versions</h2>
  Version control ensures files of the project are saved and stored properly.  It also ensures the correct naming and dates are being used.  This can be great when you need to restore a previous version (especially if your current version has an issue).  You will know exactly where to find the version.
</section>
  <section><h2>Backup-</h2>
  Since it’s stored locally as well as the repository on the server, Version Control also creates an automatic backup.
